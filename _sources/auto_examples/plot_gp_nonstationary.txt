Gaussian Processes regression: non-stationary correlation
=========================================================

A simple one-dimensional regression task which is complicated by a
discontinuity at x=0. Because of this discontinuity, the global GP
hyperparameters are chosen such that the correlation drops quickly with
increasing distance of the datapoints. This is inappropriate for all pairs of
datapoints which are not separated by the discontinuity.

A non-stationary correlation model, which assigns shorter length-scales to
regions close to the discontinuity can reduce this issue. In this script,
a local length-scale model is provided and only a global modifier of the
length scales is learned. This non-stationary model generalizes more globally
and obtains a considerably higher posterior probability.
