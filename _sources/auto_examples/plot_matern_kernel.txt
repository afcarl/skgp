Gaussian Processes regression: comparing different variants of Matern kernel
============================================================================

Gaussian Process regression with four different variants of the Matern kernel
is compared (for activ=dx.T * M * dx and M being a covariance matrix of size
n*n encoded in theta):
 * The Matern kernel for nu=1.5:
   r(theta, dx) = (1 + np.sqrt(3*activ))*exp(-np.sqrt(3*activ))
 * The Matern kernel for nu=2.5:
   r(theta, dx) = (1 + np.sqrt(5*activ) + 5/3*activ)*exp(-np.sqrt(5*activ))
 * The absolute-exponential kernel which corresponds to a Matern kernel
   with nu=0.5
 * The squared-exponential kernel which corresponds to a Matern kernel
   for the limit of nu becoming infinitely large

The target function is a twice differentiable function which is created by
fitting a spline to randomly sampled data over the interval [0, 10]. The
squared-exponential kernel is expected to be too smooth for this function
while the absolute-exponential kernel is typically too rough.

See Rasmussen and Williams 2006, pp84 for details regarding the different
variants of the Matern kernel.
